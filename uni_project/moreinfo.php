				<p align="justify">Inaugurated on the 10<sup>th</sup> of November in 1988, A.R.K Resort started serving authentic Pakistani dishes and its signature Bar.B.Q dishes.

<p align="justify">It was their devotion, and determination that turned this dream into reality, winning hearts all over the country and beyond. A.R.K Resort  is the new standard for exquisite quality and taste, serving unique varieties of cuisines to cater to every flavor, and every tongue, in its own unique style.</p>
<p align="justify">Experience fine dining at its best !</p>

Some Pakistani cuisines
International cuisine and fast food are popular in the cities. Blending local and foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is common in large urban centers. Furthermore, as a result of lifestyle changes, ready made masala mixes (mixed and ready to use spices) are becoming increasingly popular. However, given the diversity of the people of Pakistan, cuisines generally differ from home to home and may be different from the mainstream Pakistani cuisine</p>

			<h2>Our_Foods!</h2>
			<p align="justify">In A.R.K Resort Pakistanis generally eat three meals a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to Sehar and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is spread out on the floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.</p>

			<p align="justify">Shami kebabs are a popular snack throughout Indian subcontinent. They are often garnished with lemon juice and served with sliced raw onions as a side salad, and may be eaten with chutney made from mint or coriander. They are also served along with sheer khurma during Eid celebrations.</p>

			<p align="justify">The chapli kebab is a popular barbecue and street food throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of Pakistan, as well as in eastern Afghanistan and India.[1] It can be served and eaten hot with naan bread, rice, or in buns and sandwiches such as in a bun kebab</p>

			<h2>Our_Chefs!</h2>
			<p align="justify">Mehboob Khan better known as Chef Mehboob is a Pakistani chef, a television personality and a cooking expert. He is known for his cooking shows Zauq Zindagi and Good Healthy Life on ARY Zauq. He is also an author of cookbook Food for Life.[citation needed] He served as a Judge in cooking competition MasterChef Pakistan.</p>

			<p align="justify">Khan was born in 1969 to a Pathan descent family in Karachi.[citation needed] His birth name is Mehboob Mandokhel but he uses the name Khan.[citation needed] He completed his early education in Karachi and started his career as a Chef in 1986.</p>

			<p align="justify">A chef is a trained professional cook who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɛf.də.kɥi.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.</p>
<p align="justify">
There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation, such as the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, or the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production, or “Television chef”, such as Alison Holst. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word "chef" in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef's standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).</p>

			<h2>Service_No_#1!</h2>
			<p align="justify">In A.R.K Resort A fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part of a "meat-sweet diet", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.</p>

			<p align="justify">The A.R.K restaurant most associated by the public with the term "fast food" was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the "Speedee Service System" was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford..</p>

			<p align="justify">At roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King.</p>

Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper's Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.</p>

			<h2>Service_No_#04!</h2>
			<p align="justify">In A.R.K Resort Some of the large fast food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people's health. McDonald's announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.[28]</p>
<p>
In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[29] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[30][31] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Fast food is commonly blamed for the obesity epidemic in the United States today.[32] 60% of Americans today are either overweight or obese.[33] With obesity especially being seen among children, places like McDonald's and other fast food restaurants take the majority of the blame.[32] 34% of children and adolescents consume fast food on any given day, while 80% of children claim that McDonald's is their favorite place to eat at.[33] The number of children and adolescents as well as adults eating out everyday is only seen to progress and rise.[33] Research concludes that children and adolescents ranging from twelve to nineteen years old consume twice as many calories from fast food restaurants than children ranging from two to eleven years old.[33]
</p>
The FDA found that trans fats raises the amount of cholesterol in blood, which raises the chance of developing heart disease which is known as one of the leading causes of death in the U.S.[33] In a recent study, it was found that 11 out of 25 restaurants failed after tests on the use of antibiotics as well.[33] Antibiotic-resistant infections affect at least 2 million Americans each year, which will leave at least 23,000 of those people to die.[33].</p>
